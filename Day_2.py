# MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS
# Whenever you are dividing you always get floating point number
# you can add .0 to the denominator to cancel the float
# 2 to the power of 2 can be 2 ** 2 (** is used for exponent)
# PEMDAS (Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Substraction)
# in actual division, python goes from Left to Right. not minding the function there
# moving from left to right, python prioritises parenthesis()
